                        <p>This is what I did and it’s been one of the best business decisions I made for myself. 

                            I advise checking the policies of the company you’re working with to see what their terms are regarding websites. I know with Forever Living they allow you to have your own. 
                            
                            Having your own website is not only a powerful way to differentiate yourself from your competitors, but it also gives people a way to find you!
                            
                            If you find that you’re not allowed to have your own website directly related to your network marketing business, then you could make one that has a focus on a topic related to your business. 
                            
                            Building a website is a lot simpler than you think! There are tons of videos on YouTube that teach you how to build using a platform like Squarespace, Wix and WordPress etc. 
                            
                            If you don’t have time see if you know anyone who builds websites or have a look at Fiverr for a web developer. 
                            
                            Want to dive deeper into network marketing?
                            Download my “Why Network Marketing is For You Video Series” here.
                            
                            2. Build Your Personal Brand 
                            This ties in with having a website. Having a personal brand makes you look professional, offers you credibility and can help differentiate you as a leader in your business. 
                            
                            If you are generating leads online you want to make sure you’re not some ghost people are struggling to find any information about. 
                            
                            People will often buy into you first, as a brand before they look at what you’re selling. 
                            
                            Having a strong personal brand means you need to establish yourself as an expert in that field. 
                            
                            natalie heeley instagram 
                            You can do this by creating content of value that speaks to your target audience — like what I’m doing with this blog article. 
                            
                            Also, utilise your social media channels with more personal information about yourself and “behind the scenes” of your day-to-day. 
                            <br><br><br>
                            This helps to show people more of who you are, your authenticity and honesty. They’ll be able to witness your journey from the beginning and this will give them confidence that they too can walk a similar path. 
                            
                            These personal touchpoints help people to trust you which is usually what happens first before they trust your MLM company to make a buying decision or join as your down line.
                            
                            3. Build An Email List
                            Email marketing continues to be a powerful tool in not only generating leads but also in communicating with them. 
                            
                            When looking to build an email list it helps to have a website so you have a platform where you can drive people to. 
                            
                            One of the best ways I have found to acquire better quality leads is by offering something of value for free to anyone who subscribes to my email list. 
                            
                            For example, I often create eBooks packed with valuable content that can help my target audience in some way. My ‘How To Work From Home: The Ultimate Guide’ eBook was a great success and I received plenty of quality leads through that offer. 
                            
                            Make sure the offer you want people to sign up for is going to provide more value than what your blog or social media posts offer. 
                            
                            Having someone’s email address gives you direct access to communicating with them, and this is where you can really begin to build trust.

                            4. Develop A Referral Program
                            natalie heeley
                            This can work well for building a customer base for selling products. Sometimes you may find that you pitch the business opportunity to a person and they decide they want to rather be a customer at this time. 
                            
                            This is great, get them in as a customer and who knows they may decide to build a business at a later stage. 
                            
                            What you can do is ask your customers or even people who aren’t initially interested to refer others who they think may really love the products. In them doing so you could offer them a discount on their next purchase. 
                            
                            Many times people you talk to won’t be interested in buying right away, but they may know people who are.
                            
                            Customers who are happy with the product and service may want to share your product or business—use this to your benefit. 
                            
                            Similar to other businesses, people who are referred by others are easier to convert to a sale than people who weren’t because they’re usually coming to you with some interest in buying.

                            5. Host Informational Webinars
                            Hosting your own webinar is a powerful way to attract people and build your MLM leads list. 
                            
                            I host a free 30-minute Zoom presentation every week on a Monday which covers: 
                            
                            Who the MLM company is, its products and track record. 
                            The different income opportunities you can explore.
                            How you can build this business from the comfort of your home with only a laptop and wifi.  
                            webinar
                            This gives people the low down on what you’re offering and you’ll be able to gauge how interested they are. 
                            
                            It’s also extremely convenient for both parties. People don’t always have time to drive somewhere to meet you for a physical meeting. 
                            
                            Hosting an online webinar also opens you up to people from all over the world who can attend and learn more about your offer. 
                            
                            Make sure you receive an email in exchange for booking the webinar. Best way to do this is to have a landing page on your website where people can sign up. 
                            
                            Webinars are also great for using them as an educational platform or a way to get to know people better by holding a Q&A.

                            6. Blog
                            chris brogan quote
                            A blog is an incredibly effective marketing tool for a network marketing business as it gives you a way to offer your target audience value without going in for the hard sell. 
                            
                            A blog can also bring organic leads to your website if optimised correctly for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). 
                            
                            Don’t worry if all of this is shooting over your head, it did mine too in the beginning. Do your research and have a look at Neil Patel who is a great resource when it comes to blogging for marketing success.  
                            
                            A blog simply provides your readers with free tips that connect to your service or products as a solution to any problems they may be facing. 
                            
                            And this is how they can find you through Google — by searching for ways to alleviate the pain point that your blog will solve for them. 
                            
                            Having a blog puts the power back in your hands.  
                            
                            Social Media Expert Chris Brogan says “no matter what, the very first piece of social media real estate I’d start with is a blog.”
                            
                            One may not see it as social media, but it is and it’s the most important piece of internet real estate you can put into place because it belongs to you entirely. 
                            
                            Blogging expert Michael Hyatt says it this way: “You wouldn’t build a house on a rented lot, right?”
                            
                            What both experts are referring to is the fact that your social media accounts: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn…they’re all “rented lots.”
                            
                            You don’t own them and if you do anything that goes against their Terms of Service you’ll wake up one day to find your accounts have been removed, blocked or completely cleared. 
                            
                            Your blog is your very own piece of real estate. As long as you don’t use a freebie entity like Blogger, Weebly or Tumblr then you “own” it and will have all the control over it.
                            <br><br><br>
                            7. Use Social Media To Generate Network Marketing Leads Online 
                            As mentioned above, social media is a “rented lot.” So Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and make sure to diversify.
                            
                            However, with that said make the most out these powerful platforms while you can.
